# Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the project to follow Feature-Sliced Design architecture, organizing code into clear layers and segments.

## FSD Architecture Structure

### üîß App Layer (`src/app/`)
**Purpose**: Application-level configuration and initialization
- `store/` - Redux store configuration and hooks
- `styles/` - Global SCSS styles and variables

### üß© Shared Layer (`src/shared/`)
**Purpose**: Reusable code without business logic
- `components/` - Common UI components (Header)
- `ui/` - Basic UI primitives (Button, Select)

### üèóÔ∏è Entities Layer (`src/entities/`)
**Purpose**: Business entities and their models
- `news/` - News entity with model, types, and UI components
  - `model/` - News types, Redux slice, and async thunks
  - `ui/` - ArticleCard and ArticleCardSkeleton components

### ‚ö° Features Layer (`src/features/`)
**Purpose**: User interactions and features
- `news-filter/` - News filtering functionality
  - `ui/` - NewsFilters component

### üîß Widgets Layer (`src/widgets/`)
**Purpose**: Compositional UI blocks
- `news-feed/` - Complete news feed widget
  - `ui/` - NewsFeed component

### üìÑ Pages Layer (`src/pages/`)
**Purpose**: Full page components
- `main/` - Main page composition

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic separated from UI components
- Clear dependencies between layers
- Each layer has a specific responsibility

### 2. **Improved Import Structure**
```typescript
// Before (scattered imports)
import { Article } from "../types/news";
import { useAppDispatch } from "../redux/hooks";

// After (FSD imports)
import { Article, fetchNews } from "../../../entities/news";
import { useAppDispatch } from "../../../app/store/hooks";
```

### 3. **Better Scalability**
- New features can be added without affecting existing code
- Each entity is self-contained with its own model and UI
- Clear API surface through index.ts exports

### 4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Intuitive file organization
- Easier to navigate and understand codebase
- Consistent naming conventions

## Migration Changes

### File Reorganization
- **Entities**: ArticleCard, ArticleCardSkeleton, news types, newsSlice ‚Üí `entities/news/`
- **Features**: NewsFilters ‚Üí `features/news-filter/`
- **Widgets**: NewsFeed ‚Üí `widgets/news-feed/`
- **Shared**: Header, Button, Select ‚Üí `shared/`
- **App**: Store configuration and global styles ‚Üí `app/`

### Updated Import Paths
All components now use proper FSD import paths respecting the layer dependency rules.

### Index Files
Created barrel exports in each segment for cleaner imports:
```typescript
// entities/news/index.ts
export { ArticleCard, ArticleCardSkeleton } from './ui';
export { fetchNews, newsReducer } from './model';
export type { Article, NewsFilters } from './model';
```

## Technical Stack Compatibility
‚úÖ Redux Toolkit with FSD architecture  
‚úÖ SCSS with component-specific styles  
‚úÖ TypeScript with proper type exports  
‚úÖ Vite build system compatibility  

## Current Status
üöÄ **Project successfully refactored and running**
- Development server operational on port 5174
- All functionality preserved
- Build process working correctly
- Only minor SCSS deprecation warnings (non-breaking)

## Next Steps
- Consider migrating from `@import` to `@use` in SCSS files
- Add more features following FSD patterns
- Implement additional entities as the project grows
